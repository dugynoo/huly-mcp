MCP server for [Huly](https://huly.io/) integration — 209 tools across 23 categories (issues, projects, tasks, comments, documents, cards, channels, calendar, time tracking, test management, processes, custom fields, attachments, leads and more). Supports custom task types with project-scoped status workflows and read-side Process plugin tools.

## Installation

The standard configuration works with most MCP clients:

```json
{
  "mcpServers": {
    "huly": {
      "command": "npx",
      "args": ["-y", "@dugynoo/huly-mcp@latest"],
      "env": {
        "HULY_URL": "https://huly.app",

        "HULY_PASSWORD": "yourpassword",
        "HULY_WORKSPACE": "yourworkspace"
      }
    }
  }
}
```

## Updating

The `@latest` tag in the install command always fetches the newest version. Most MCP clients cache the installed package, so you need to force a re-fetch:

| Client | How to update |
|--------|--------------|
| **Claude Code** | `claude mcp remove huly` then re-add with the install command above |
| **Claude Desktop** | Restart the app (it runs `npx` on startup) |
| **VS Code / Cursor** | Restart the MCP server from the command palette or reload the window |
| **npx (manual)** | `npx -y @dugynoo/huly-mcp@latest` — the `-y` flag skips the cache when `@latest` resolves to a new version |

## HTTP Transport

By default, the server uses stdio transport. For HTTP transport (Streamable HTTP):

```bash
HULY_URL=https://huly.app \
HULY_EMAIL=your@email.com \
HULY_PASSWORD=yourpassword \
HULY_WORKSPACE=yourworkspace \
MCP_TRANSPORT=http \
npx -y @dugynoo/huly-mcp@latest
```

Server listens on `http://127.0.0.1:3000/mcp` by default.

Configure with `MCP_HTTP_PORT` and `MCP_HTTP_HOST`:

```bash
MCP_TRANSPORT=http MCP_HTTP_PORT=8080 MCP_HTTP_HOST=0.0.0.0 npx -y @dugynoo/huly-mcp@latest
```

## Environment Variables

| Variable | Required | Description |

## Differences from `@firfi/huly-mcp`

This package is a downstream of [`@firfi/huly-mcp`](https://github.com/dearlordylord/huly-mcp) with two additions:

- **`taskType` parameter on `create_issue` and `update_issue`** so issues can be created with custom task types (e.g. `Ticket`, `Bug`, `Feature`) and project-scoped status workflows (`Created`, `Awaiting approval`, etc.). Without this, issues created via MCP fall back to the default task type even when the project defines its own.
- **Read-side Process plugin tools**: `list_processes`, `get_process`, `list_executions`. Requires a Huly server with the Process plugin enabled (v0.7.382+).

Original upstream copyright is preserved in [`LICENSE`](./LICENSE).

## Troubleshooting

### Passwords with special characters

If your Huly password contains characters like `*`, `%`, `!`, or `#`, passing it via the CLI `-e` flag may fail because the shell interprets these characters before they reach the process.

**Solution**: Edit your MCP config file directly instead of using `claude mcp add -e`. In `~/.claude.json` (user scope) or `.mcp.json` (project scope), JSON handles all special characters natively:

```json
{
  "mcpServers": {
    "huly": {
      "type": "stdio",
      "command": "node",
      "args": ["path/to/dist/index.cjs"],
      "env": {
        "HULY_URL": "https://your-huly-instance.com",
        "HULY_EMAIL": "you@example.com",
        "HULY_PASSWORD": "p@ss*w0rd!#%",
        "HULY_WORKSPACE": "your-workspace"
      }
    }
  }
}
```

Alternatively, use `HULY_TOKEN` instead of email/password to bypass password auth entirely (see [Environment Variables](#environment-variables)).

### MCP client shows "Failed to reconnect"

After changing MCP configuration, some clients (including Claude Code) require a full restart — not just a reconnect. Exit the application completely and reopen it.

You can verify the connection works independently with:
```bash
claude mcp list  # Should show "Connected"
```

### Self-hosted Huly: account locked after failed login attempts

Huly locks password login after 5 failed API authentication attempts. This commonly happens during initial setup when the password is misconfigured. The lock persists in the database across service restarts.

**Symptoms**: `PasswordLoginLocked` error from the MCP server, and the Huly web UI shows "Password login is locked due to too many failed attempts. Please use an OTP login method to unlock your account." (OTP won't work without SMTP configured.)

**Fix** — reset the lock counter in CockroachDB:

```bash
# Find your account UUID and check lock status
docker exec -e PGPASSWORD=<your_cockroach_password> <cockroach_container> \
  cockroach sql --host=localhost --user=<db_user> --database=defaultdb --insecure \
  -e "SELECT uuid, failed_login_attempts FROM global_account.account;"

# Reset the counter
docker exec -e PGPASSWORD=<your_cockroach_password> <cockroach_container> \
  cockroach sql --host=localhost --user=<db_user> --database=defaultdb --insecure \
  -e "UPDATE global_account.account SET failed_login_attempts = 0 WHERE uuid = '<your_account_uuid>';"
```

The CockroachDB credentials can be found in your Huly `compose.yml` or via `docker exec <cockroach_container> env | grep COCKROACH`.

### Windows-specific notes

- **Bash wrapper scripts** (sourcing `.env` files) may not work reliably when launched by MCP clients on Windows. Prefer setting env vars directly in the MCP config JSON.
- **Docker pulls over SSH** may fail on Windows due to credential manager issues. Pull images from the server desktop if needed.
