# @dugynoo/huly-mcp

## 0.14.0

### Minor Changes

- **Process write-side ops** — added `start_process` and `cancel_execution` MCP tools. `start_process` resolves the process by ID/name, locates the first workflow state (lowest rank), and creates an active Execution; the Huly server's process engine then auto-fires OnExecutionStart triggers. `cancel_execution` is idempotent.
- **Associations module (new)** — added 5 tools for the `core:class:Association` / `core:class:Relation` graph: `list_associations`, `create_association`, `list_relations`, `create_relation`, `delete_relation`. Both creates are idempotent.
- **User Statuses module (new)** — added `list_user_statuses` tool reading from `core:class:UserStatus` so agents can answer "who is online right now?" with timestamps.

Total tool count: 209 → 218 (8 new + 1 modified).

## 0.13.0

### Minor Changes

- Add `taskType` parameter to `create_issue` and `update_issue` so issues can be created with custom Huly task types (e.g. `"Ticket"`, `"Bug"`) and project-scoped statuses (such as `"Created"`, `"Awaiting approval"`). Default behaviour is unchanged when `taskType` is omitted.
- Add read-side support for the Huly **Process** plugin (introduced server-side in v0.7.382): new tools `list_processes`, `get_process`, `list_executions`. Process plugin class refs mirrored manually due to upstream `@hcengineering/*` packages shipping without TypeScript declarations (see [platform#10881](https://github.com/hcengineering/platform/issues/10881)).

## 0.12.0

### Minor Changes

- Add the `create_direct_message` tool for idempotently opening one-to-one Huly direct-message conversations by exact workspace-member email or display name.
- Harden direct-message creation by rejecting self-DMs, ignoring group DMs during one-to-one reuse checks, surfacing ambiguous person matches, and resolving email identities through both SocialIdentity and email Channel records.

## 0.11.0

### Minor Changes

- Add the `create_access_link` workspace tool for creating Huly access links, including anonymous reusable guest links with second-based validity windows and optional space restrictions.

## 0.10.3

### Patch Changes

- Rebuild the published package artifact so contact responses include workbench URLs.

## 0.10.2

### Patch Changes

- Expose Huly workbench URLs on contact person, employee, and organization responses.

## 0.10.1

### Patch Changes

- Harden direct-message operations by enforcing authenticated-account membership, resolving participant names only for one-to-one DMs, mapping DM lookup errors to invalid params, and resolving DM message senders through social identities.

## 0.10.0

### Minor Changes

- Add writable calendar discovery and explicit calendar targeting for event creation.

  Event creation now resolves the authenticated user's primary personal calendar by default instead of selecting an arbitrary calendar. `create_event` and `create_recurring_event` accept an optional `calendarId`, and `list_calendars` returns writable calendar targets for agents that need to choose one explicitly.

## 0.9.3

### Patch Changes

- Allow `list_leads` assignee filters to accept person display names as well as email addresses.
- Omit empty reaction creator IDs from `list_reactions` output so freshly added reactions encode cleanly.

## 0.9.2

### Patch Changes

- Make `create_issue_status` tolerate failures from the broad existing-status recovery lookup reported on older self-hosted Huly instances, while preserving idempotency for statuses already linked to the selected project type.

## 0.9.1

### Patch Changes

- Document the `create_document` `parent` option in the MCP tool description and generated README so agents can discover nested document creation from the tool list.

## 0.9.0

### Minor Changes

- Add task-management workflow tools for discovering project/task types and safely extending tracker configuration.

  New MCP tools:

  - `list_project_types`
  - `get_project_type`
  - `list_task_types`
  - `create_task_type`
  - `create_issue_status`

  The create tools are idempotent, recover partially linked workspace configuration, validate status category mismatches, and include integration coverage against a live Huly workspace.

## 0.8.0

### Minor Changes

- fa2133b: Add `update_channel_message` and `delete_channel_message` tools so edits to channel posts (e.g. fixing a bad link after send) no longer require a second message stacked on top. Mirrors the existing thread-reply edit/delete surface, reuses the existing `MessageNotFoundError` and `ChannelNotFoundError` error classes, and places the operations in `channels-messages.ts` alongside the pattern used by `documents-edit.ts`.
- 91ec770: Include a `url` field (typed as `UrlString`) on every document result (`list_documents`, `get_document`, `create_document`, `edit_document`) pointing directly at the document in the Huly web app. The URL is built from the connected workspace's `WorkspaceLoginInfo.workspaceUrl` slug and a title-derived path segment (`<baseUrl>/workbench/<workspaceUrl>/document/<title-slug>-<id>`), matching the links Huly itself produces. This removes a common failure mode where callers constructed URLs from the raw `WorkspaceUuid` and hit the login-loop page instead of the document.

## 0.7.0

### Minor Changes

- Prepare the next minor release from the four merged PRs since `v0.6.3`.

  - Add nested document creation with `create_document(parent)` for creating children under an existing document.
  - Fix markup conversion to use workspace-aware URL configuration so generated links and asset references resolve correctly for the active workspace.
  - Add lead and funnel tools with stronger SDK parity, deterministic funnel name resolution, and integration coverage for real workspace lead reads.
  - Add organization CRM and customer-management tools, including organization CRUD, customer mixin support, organization channels, member linking, ambiguity-safe lookup, idempotent membership operations, and cleanup-safe integration coverage.

## 0.6.3

### Patch Changes

- dbd3aea: Fix assignee resolution for workspace members whose email exists only as a SocialIdentity by moving the lookup into the shared person resolver and prioritizing it ahead of Channel-based lookups.

## 0.6.2

### Patch Changes

- Fix assignee resolution for workspace members whose email exists only as a SocialIdentity (no Channel doc). Adds SocialIdentity email lookup as the first step in findPersonByEmailOrName, benefiting all person-resolving operations.

## 0.6.1

### Patch Changes

- Fix local-release script to rebuild dist before publish, preventing stale version string in bundle

## 0.6.0

### Minor Changes

- ef56789: Add custom fields support with auto-discovery: `list_custom_fields`, `get_custom_field_values`, and `set_custom_field`. The server now discovers field definitions from Huly's Attribute system without manual configuration and supports Cards, Issues, and other classes with custom fields.

  Harden typed outputs for the new custom-fields, issue-relations, time, and workspace tool surfaces. These tools now validate and encode their MCP responses through Effect schemas at the boundary so branded internal domain values are converted to stable wire output and invalid result shapes fail fast instead of leaking through the transport layer.

## 0.5.4

### Patch Changes

- chore: add pre-publish version string verification to prevent stale dist

## 0.5.3

### Patch Changes

- fix: bake correct version string into published dist

## 0.5.2

### Patch Changes

- fix: add uploadMarkup for milestone collaborative documents (#18), consistent guard and dual-write comment

## 0.5.1

### Patch Changes

- 335a5fa: Fix Markup conversion for issue templates and milestones — descriptions now render markdown formatting correctly in Huly UI. Extract shared markup conversion helpers into dedicated module.
- 3fb294d: fix: consistent uploadMarkup guard and dual-write comment for milestone descriptions

## 0.5.0

### Minor Changes

- 81c6ab2: Add custom fields support with auto-discovery: list_custom_fields, get_custom_field_values, set_custom_field tools. Auto-discovers field definitions from Huly's Attribute system without manual configuration. Works for Cards, Issues, and any class with custom fields.

## 0.4.0

### Minor Changes

- d81267c: feat: add dueDate and estimation support for issue creation and updates

## 0.3.2

### Patch Changes

- fix: move bundled dependencies to devDependencies to fix npx install

## 0.3.1

### Patch Changes

- Pin @hcengineering/\* dependencies to exact versions to avoid broken 0.7.382 release with unresolved workspace: protocol

## 0.3.0

### Minor Changes

- feat: add get_version tool returning current and latest npm version

## 0.2.0

### Minor Changes

- Add link_document_to_issue and unlink_document_from_issue tools for associating documents with tracker issues. Enhance list_issue_relations to return linked documents with resolved titles and teamspace names.

## 0.1.62

### Patch Changes

- feat: add `list_statuses` and `list_inline_comments` tools

  - `list_statuses`: returns project statuses with isDone, isCanceled, isDefault flags — useful for LLMs to pick valid statuses when creating/updating issues
  - `list_inline_comments`: extracts inline comment threads from document markup with optional thread reply fetching including sender names

## 0.1.61

### Patch Changes

- Remove unnecessary browser polyfills (fake-indexeddb, window, navigator) — all @hcengineering packages guard these with typeof checks. The window mock was actively harmful, defeating browser-detection guards.
